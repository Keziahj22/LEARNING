## ✅ **What is a Database?**

An **ordered collection of data** that is stored and accessed electronically from a computing system.

### 🔹 Data Types:
```
                 DATA
           _______|_______
          |               |
     Structured       Unstructured
    (e.g., Tables,      (e.g., Images,
     CSV Files)           Videos, Audio)
```

## ✅ **What is DBMS?**

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that allows users to **create, access, manage, and manipulate databases** easily.

### 🔹 Examples:
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* Oracle DB

## ❓ **Why DBMS over Flat File Systems?**
* Avoids **data redundancy**
* Provides **security and access control**
* Ensures **data integrity and consistency**
* Supports **backup and recovery**
* Easier **data sharing** among multiple users

## ⚙️ **Components of DBMS**

1. **Hardware** – Physical devices (servers, storage)
2. **Software** – DBMS software itself
3. **Data** – The actual data stored in the system
4. **Procedures** – Instructions and rules for using the DBMS
5. **Database Access Language (DAL)** – SQL or other query languages
6. **Users** – DB administrators, developers, end-users

## 🗂️ **Types of DBMS Models**

| Model                     | Description                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Hierarchical**       | Tree-like structure (Parent-child relationship)  |
| **2. Relational (RDBMS)** | Table format (rows & columns) – Most common      |
| **3. Network**            | Graph structure – Supports complex relationships |
| **4. Object-Oriented**    | Data stored as objects (like in OOP programming) |
