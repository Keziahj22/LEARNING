### üîç Adversarial Search / Game Tree Search

#### 1. Minimax Algorithm (Two Players)

* **Definition**: It is a recursive algorithm used for choosing the next move in two-player games.
* **Player Types**:

  * MAX player tries to get the maximum score.
  * MIN player tries to get the minimum score.
* **Working**:

  * Traverse the game tree.
  * At terminal nodes, calculate utility.
  * Backtrack and assign values to parent nodes depending on MIN or MAX.

##### Example Tree:

```
          A (MAX)
        /    |    \
      B      C      D (MIN)
     /\     /\     /\
    3 5   6 9   1 2
```

* A will choose max(B, C, D) = max(min(3,5), min(6,9), min(1,2)) = max(3,6,1) = 6

#### 2. Alpha-Beta Pruning

* **Purpose**: Optimize minimax by pruning unnecessary branches.
* **Alpha (Œ±)**: Maximum lower bound of possible solutions.
* **Beta (Œ≤)**: Minimum upper bound.
* **Cutoff**: If Œ± ‚â• Œ≤, stop evaluating the branch.

##### Example:

```
      MAX
     /   \
   MIN   MIN
  / \    / \
 3  5   6  ?  => If left MIN returns 3, and right branch starts with 6 (worse for MIN), prune remaining
```

#### 3. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

* **Used In**: Games with high complexity (Go, Chess)
* **Steps**:

  1. **Selection**: Traverse tree from root to leaf by selecting best child (UCT formula).
  2. **Expansion**: Add new child node.
  3. **Simulation**: Play random moves till end.
  4. **Backpropagation**: Update stats (win/loss) of visited nodes.

##### UCT Formula:

```
UCT = w_i/n_i + c * sqrt(ln(N_i)/n_i)
```

Where:

* w\_i = win score of node i
* n\_i = visits to node i
* N\_i = visits to parent of i
* c = exploration constant (‚àö2)

#### Unification in FOL

* Process of making two predicates identical by finding a substitution.
* **Example**:

1. Check predicates and their arity.
2. Match arguments left to right.
3. Replace variables with constants/expressions.

##### Solve: `p(x, g(x)) =? f(prime, f(prime))`

* Not unifiable as predicates and structure mismatch.

#### Resolution in Propositional Logic

* Proof technique to derive a conclusion using contradiction.
* Convert statements into CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form).
* Apply resolution rule to eliminate clauses.

##### Example:

1. A ‚à® B
2. ¬¨B ‚à® C
3. Resolve 1 & 2 ‚áí A ‚à® C
